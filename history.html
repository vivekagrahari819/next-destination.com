                <p>What is the brief history of India? The history of India starts with the existence of India itself as
                    It located in the continent of Asia, India covers 2,973,193 square kilometers of land and 314,070
                    square kilometers of water.
                    <br>


                    Making it the 7th largest nation in the world with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometers.
                    Surrounded by Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh to the North East, China to the North, Pakistan to the
                    North West, and Sri Lanka on the South East coast.

                    <br>

                    India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic, and cultural configurations are
                    the products of a long process of regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the
                    Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are usually described as
                    the pre-Vedic and Vedic age. Hinduism arose in the Vedic period.

                    <br>

                    The fifth-century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it
                    is in his reign that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came to
                    India for the first time and by the eleventh century had firmly established itself in India as a
                    political force. It resulted in the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by
                    the Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large measure of political unity. <br>

                <p>It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This coincided with the disintegration
                    of the Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional states. In the contest for supremacy, the English
                    emerged 'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58, which sought to restore Indian supremacy, was crushed;
                    and with the subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress of India, the incorporation of India into
                    the empire was complete. It was followed by India's struggle for independence, which we got in the
                    year 1947. Here is a brief timeline about the history of India:</p>

                <h4>Ancient India History </h4>
                <p>
                    The History of India begins with the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These
                    two phases are generally described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic periods. The earliest literary source
                    that sheds light on India's past is the Rig Veda. It is difficult to date this work with any
                    accuracy on the basis of tradition and ambiguous astronomical information contained in the hymns.
                    Indus valley civilization, which flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, had an advanced and
                    flourishing economic system. The Indus valley people practiced agriculture, domesticated animals,
                    made tools and weapons from copper, bronze, and tin and even traded with some Middle East countries.
                </p>

                <h4>The Indus Valley Civilization</h4>
                <p>A long time ago, in the eastern world, there rose a few civilizations. The main reasons for the rise
                    of these urban civilizations were access to rivers, which served various functions of human beings.
                    Along with the Mesopotamian civilization and the Egyptian civilization, rose the Indus Valley
                    civilization spanning Northwest India and modern-day Pakistan. The largest amongst the three
                    civilizations, the Indus Valley civilization flourished around 2600 BC, at which time agriculture in
                    India started flourishing. The fertile Indus valley made it possible for agriculture to be carried
                    out on a large scale. The most well-known towns of the Indus Valley in today’s date are Mohenjo Daro
                    and Harappa. Unearthing these two towns showed excavators glimpses into the richness of the Indus
                    Valley civilization, evidenced in ruins and things like household articles, war weapons, gold and
                    silver ornament - and so on. The people of the Indus Valley civilization lived in well-planned towns
                    and well-designed houses made of baked bricks. In an era of developments and prosperity,
                    civilization, unfortunately, came to an end by around 1300 BC, mainly due to natural calamities.
                </p>

                <h4>Vedic Civilization</h4>
                <p>The next era that India saw was that of the Vedic civilization, flourishing along the river
                    Saraswati, named after the Vedas, which depict the early literature of the Hindus. The two greatest
                    epics of this period were the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, still held in great reverence by the
                    followers of Hinduism.</p>

                <h4>Buddhist Era</h4>
                <p>Next came the Buddhist era, during the time of the Mahajanapadas which were the sixteen great powers,
                    during the 7th and the 6th centuries BC. Prominent powers at the time were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu
                    and the Licchavis of Vaishali. Buddha, whose original name was Siddhartha Gautam, was born in
                    Lumbini near Kapilavastu and was the founder of Buddhism - a religion based on spiritualism. He died
                    at the age of 80 in 480 BC but his teachings spread throughout southern and eastern Asia and are
                    followed across the world today</p>

                <h4> The Invasion of Alexander </h4>

                When Alexander invaded India in 326 BC, he crossed the Indus river and defeated the Indian rulers in
                battle. Noteworthy of the Indians’ attempts at war, was the use of elephants, something that the
                Macedonians had never seen before. Alexander then took over the lands of the defeated kings.
<br>


                <h4> The Gupta Dynasty
                </h4>
                The Gupta period has been referred to as the Golden Age of Indian history. When Chandragupt I received
                the gift of Pataliputra in dowry when he married the daughter of the chief of the ‘Licchavis’, he
                started to lay down the foundation of his empire, which extended from the river Ganges or the Ganga to
                the city of Allahabad. He ruled for 15 years and was also referred to as the ‘king of kings’ for his
                strategic conquests and the flourishing state of India.

<br>

                <h4> Harshavardhana
                </h4>

                The last of the ancient kingdoms in India was by the king Harshavardhana, who ascended the throne at
                Thanneshwar and Kannauj after his brother died. While successful in a few of his conquests, he
                eventually got defeated by the Chalukya Kingdom of Deccan India. Harshavardhana was well-known for
                establishing relations with the Chinese, and also for having high religious tolerance and strong
                administrative capabilities.
<br>


                <h4> Medieval Indian History
                </h4> The medieval history of India is renowned for deriving a lot of its character from Islamic
                kingdoms. Extending across almost three generations, medieval India included a number of kingdoms and
                dynasties:
                - The Chalukyas
                - The Pallavas
                - The Pandyas
                - The Rashtrakutas
                - The Cholas
<br>

                The Cholas were the most important rulers at this time, the 9th Century AD. Their kingdom covered a
                large part of South India, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. While the rulers ruled bravely and
                carried out the annexation of multiple territories in India, the empire came to an end in the 14th
                Century AD with an invasion by a man named Kafur Malik. The monuments from the Chola Dynasty are still
                intact and are known for their rustic charm.


                The next major empire was that of the Mughals, preceded by a rise in Islamic rulers. The invasion of
                Timur was a significant point in Indian history before a Hindu revival movement called the Bhakti
                movement, came to be. Finally, in the 16th Century, the Mughal empire started to rise. One of the
                greatest empires of India, the Mughal empire was a rich and glorious one, with the whole of India united
                and ruled by one monarch. The Mughal Kings were Babar, Humayun, Sher Shah Suri (not a Mughal king),
                Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. They were responsible for setting up efficient public
                administration, laying out infrastructure, and promoting the arts. A large number of monuments in India
                today exist from the Mughal period. The death of the last Mughal King, Aurangzeb, sowed the seeds of
                disintegration within India. Influencers of Islamic architecture in India, the Mughal kings are still
                looked back in awe.


<br>
                <h4>Akbar
                </h4>
                Emperor Akbar, also known as Akbar the Great or Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, was the third emperor of the
                Mughal Empire, after Babur and Humayun. He was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and succeeded him as the
                emperor in the year 1556 when he was only 13 years old.

                <br>

                <h4>Shah Jahan
                </h4>
                Shah Jahan, also known as Shahbuddin Mohammed Shah Jahan, was a Mughal Emperor who ruled in the Indian
                Subcontinent from 1628 to 1658. He was the fifth Mughal ruler, after Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and
                Jahangir. Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after revolting against his father, Jahangir.


                <br>
                <h4>Chhatrapati Shivaji
                </h4>
                Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to
                be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a
                part of the folklore. King Shivaji used the guerrilla tactics to capture a part of, the then, dominant
                Mughal empire.


                <br>
                <h4>Modern Indian History
                </h4>
                During the late 16th and the 17th Centuries, the European trading companies in India competed with each
                other ferociously. By the last quarter of the 18th Century, the English had outdone all others and
                established themselves as the dominant power in India. The British administered India for a period of
                about two centuries and brought about revolutionary changes in the social, political and economic life
                of the country. <br>

                However, the zenith of colonisation was achieved when the British arrived in the early 1600s as traders.
                Capitalizing on the disintegration that existed in India after the Mughal rule, the British actively
                used the strategy of ‘divide-and-rule’ to rule over India for over 2 centuries. While the British had
                come in earlier, they only achieved political power in 1757 AD after the Battle of Plassey. <br>

                They took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offered and have been looked back at as
                plunderers of India’s wealth of resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst numerous
                other resources. While they did lay out a massive chunk of India’s infrastructure, by also bringing the
                Indians steam engines, it is seldom looked back at as an equal relationship. The British Raj was
                divisive and pit Indians against one another, on the basis of religion; and also mistreated the
                laborers. The Indians were essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without any
                returns on their work. This, naturally, led to multiple mutinies; and prominent freedom fighters came to
                the forefront. Different ideologies of thought believed that there were different ways of gaining
                freedom; however, they all had one common goal - freedom. <br>

                The British queen had asserted that the aim of the British was to help India progress - however,
                multiple problems arose without the consultation of Indian leaders. One important instance of this was
                when in the First World War, Britain launched an attack on Germany on behalf of India, even though India
                did not wish for that to happen; and millions of Indian soldiers were at the forefront of the British
                Indian Army during both the world wars - further fuelling the Indian resistance. Over a million Indian
                soldiers were killed in both the World Wars. <br>
