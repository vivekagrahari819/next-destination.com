                    about the tour </h2>
                <p style="margin: 30px ; "> Starting with your arrival in Guwahati, you will be taken to Shillong by our
                    representative who will meet you at the airport itself. After your arrival, you are free to explore
                    Shillong and feel why exactly this place is loved so much. The next day will be dedicated to a
                    transfer to Cherrapunji, where you will see Dainthlen falls, Nohkalikai Falls, Nohsngithiang Falls,
                    and Mawsmai Caves, alongside the Thangkharang Park, the post which you will return to Shillong, to
                    spend unforgettable moments at the Shillong Peak.

                    And after a day of local sightseeing in Shillong, you will head to the Kaziranga National Park, to
                    see Indian Elephants, Deer, and some of the rarest birds, all on a jeep safari. The tour then takes
                    a turn towards Bhalukpong, only to head towards one of the most beautiful monasteries in the country
                    in the hill station of Tawang. The best part about this monastery high up in the clouds is that it
                    was the birthplace of the 6th Dalai Lama of Buddhism, is more than 400 years old and has still
                    somehow retained all of its original charms. The next transfer will take you to the beautiful valley
                    of Dirang, where you will be seeing Kiwi gardens, Sangti Valley, and the Zimthung viewpoint.

                    You will then leave to visit the Nameri National Park, which is the home to a variety of Flora and
                    Fauna specific to this region. After having a ball of a time here, you will return back to Guwahati
                    where you will spend an amazing day out visiting Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra, State Museum and to
                    Emporiums for ethnic local products, Maa Kamakhya Temple, Navagraha Temple, Shukleshwar Temple &
                    Balaji Temple, before getting a final drop off to the airport after checking-out. From here, you
                    will be taking your return flight, packed with a lot of memories and souvenirs collected from here
                    on this North East tour package. </p>
